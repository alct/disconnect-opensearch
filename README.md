# Disconnect OpenSearch

This application generates custom [OpenSearch description documents](http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications/OpenSearch/1.1#OpenSearch_description_document) for [Disconnect Search](https://search.disconnect.me/searchTerms/).

Because OpenSearch is [supported by a series of web browsers](http://www.opensearch.org/Community/OpenSearch_search_clients) and the Disconnect Search developers are kind enough to allow for custom queries, there is no need to install a browser extension to use Disconnect Search.

Hosted version: [Disconnect OpenSearch](http:/loconte.be/tmp/disconnect-opensearch/)
